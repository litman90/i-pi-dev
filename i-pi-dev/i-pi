"""Main script from which the simulation is run.

Deals with creation of the simulation object, reading the input file and
initialising the system.

Run using:
      i-pi input_file.xml

Where 'input_file.xml' should be replaced by the name of the xml input file from
which the system data will be read. For a description of how the input file
should be formatted, see the reference manual.
