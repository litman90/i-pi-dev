Examples of usage of the DFTB+ i-PI interface 
=============================================

This folder contains examples for running DFTB+ as the backend of i-PI.

Examples exploit fairly advanced features of i-PI, including replica exchange,
threaded execution, and the evaluation of isotope fractionation estimators.
