Notes about the Documentations:
===============

To Verify:
----------

inputs/ensemble.py

* Is the temperature actually in kelvin by default?
* Are the stress and the eens something useful mostly on restart?
* Is the stress tensor a 9-length array?


Suggestions:
------------
* Never write a tag without the parent in an example. In this way it
  will always be clear where the tag must appear in the input.
